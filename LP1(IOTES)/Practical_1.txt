1. Differentiate between Raspberry-pi, Beaglebone and Arduino.
Raspberry-pi: It has a clock speed of 700Mhz with core ram of 256MB. The processor used is of ARM-11 architecture.
Minimum power requirement is 700mA (3.5W) and input voltage required is 5V.
It supports 2 USB 2.0 ports with HDMI or Composite port for video output and HDMI or Analog for audio output. It supports no Analog input ports.

Arduino: It has a clock speed of 16Mhz with core ram of 2KB. The processor used is of ATMega 328 architecture.
Minimum power requirement is of 42mA (0.3W) and input voltage required is 7to 12V.
It supports no USB port, Video output port or Audio port. It has 6 10-bit  analog input ports.

BeagleBone: It has a clock speed of 700Mhz with core ram of 256MB. The processor used is of ARM Cortex-A8 architecture.
Minimum power requirement is 170mA (0.85W) and input voltage required is 5V.
It supports 1 USB 2.0 ports with only Analog audio output port and not video ouput port.
